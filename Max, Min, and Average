#Purpose: This program lets you enter in numbers into a data set and finds the maximum, minimum, and avaerage values of the data set.

#Asks the user how many numbers you want in the data set.
size = float(raw_input("How many numbers do you want in your data set? "))

#Initialize the count variable and numbers list.
count = 1
numbers = []

#While loop adds the numbers to the list.
while count <= size:
    number = int(raw_input("Enter number: "))
    numbers.append(number)
    count += 1

#Set the first number in the list as the temporary maximum value.    
maxNumber = numbers[0]

#For Loop finds the maximum value in the data set.
for i in range(0, len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] > maxNumber:
        maxNumber = numbers[i]
print "The maximum value is: " + str(maxNumber)

#Set the first number in the list as the temporary minimum value.
minNumber = numbers[0]

#For Loop finds the minimum value in the data set.
for j in range(0, len(numbers)):
    if numbers[j] < minNumber:
        minNumber = numbers[j]
print "The minimum value is: " + str(minNumber)

#Initialize the add variable.
add = 0

#For Loop finds the sum of all the numbers in the list.
for k in range(0, len(numbers)):
    add += numbers[k]

#Calculates the average of all the numbers in the data set.
average = add / size

#Rounds the average to two decimal places.
roundAverage = round(average, 2)

print "The average is: " + str(roundAverage)
