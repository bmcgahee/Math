//Purpose:  This C++ program lets the user calculate the maximum area and dimensions of a rectangular fencing structure by
//providing the amount of fencing and the number of partitions that divide this structure.

#include<iostream>

//objective() function tells the user what the goal is to be achieved in this program.

    cout << "You want to create a rectangular fencing structure that will be divided by either 2 or 3 partitions on your family farm.\n";
    cout << "You want to know what the dimensions will be for this rectangular structure and the maximum area that will be achieved.\n";
}

//calcMaxArea() function calculates the maximum area by taking in the known values
//such as total amount of fencing and the number of partitions.

    else if(numberOfPartitions == 3)
    {
        maxArea = totalFencing * totalFencing / 32.0;
    }
    return maxArea;

//dimensions() function determines the length and width of the rectangular strucutre by
//knowing the total amount of fencing and the number of partitions.
