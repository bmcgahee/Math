#Title: Decimal To Binary
#Date: 9/30/2015
#Purpose: This program converts a zero or positive decimal number to a binary number.  

#Ask the user to input a decimal number.
decimal = int(raw_input("Enter the decimal number you want to convert to binary: "))
#While loop executes if the decimal number is negative.
while decimal < 0:
    decimal = int(raw_input("Enter the decimal number you want to convert to binary: "))
#The zero case.
if decimal == 0:
    #Prints the decimal and binary numbers, which are both 0.
    print "Decimal: 0"
    print "Binary: 0"
#Here's the non-zero case.
else:
    #Declare empty binary string and new variable Decimal.
    binary = ""
    Decimal = decimal
    #While loop executes when decimal is non-zero.
    while Decimal != 0:
        #binary stores the remainder after division.
        binary = str(Decimal % 2) + binary
        #Decimal stores the quotient that will be used to get the next remainder on next iteration.
        Decimal = Decimal / 2
    #Converts the binary string into an integer.
    intBinary = int(binary)
    #Prints the decimal and binary numbers.
    print "Decimal: " + str(decimal)
    print "Binary: " + str(intBinary)
