#Date:  2/28/2016
#Purpose: This program asks the user to input three sides to determine if the polygon is a triangle.
#If the polygon is a triangle, then the program determines what type of triangle it is.

#Import time module.
import time

#Set triangle variable to "yes".
triangle = "yes"

#While loop executes when the value of triangle is "yes".
while triangle.lower() == "yes":
    #Asks users to input length of each side.  If the side length is less than or equal to 0,
    #then user is taken to the inner while loop and is prompted to enter a length for the side.
    side1 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of first side: "))
    while side1 <= 0:
        side1 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of first side: "))
        
    side2 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of second side: "))
    while side2 <= 0:
        side2 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of second side: "))
        
    side3 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of third side: "))
    while side3 <= 0:
        side3 = float(raw_input("Enter the length of third side: "))

    #Sum variables add up the first and second sides, second and third sides, and first and third sides.
    sum12 = side1 + side2
    sum23 = side2 + side3
    sum13 = side1 + side3

    #Sum squared variables add up sum of squares for first and second sides, second and third sides, and first and third sides.
    sumSquared12 = side1 * side1 + side2 * side2
    sumSquared23 = side2 * side2 + side3 * side3
    sumSquared13 = side1 * side1 + side3 * side3

    #Side squared variables square first, second, and third sides.
    squareSide1 = side1 * side1
    squareSide2 = side2 * side2
    squareSide3 = side3 * side3

    #Program determines if the polygon is a triangle and includes a 3 second delay.
    print "Is the three sided polygon a triangle?  Let's find out..."
    time.sleep(3)
    #Case for when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
    if sum12 > side3 and sum23 > side1 and sum13 > 2:
        #Program confirms the polygon is a triangle and wants to see what type of triangle it is.
        #There is a 3 second delay. 
        print "The three sided polygon is a triangle."
        print "Let's see what type of triangle it is..."
        time.sleep(3)
        #Case for an equilateral triangle where all the sides are equal length.
        if side1 == side2 and side2 == side3:
            print "It is an equilateral triangle."
        #Case for an isosceles triangle where two sides have equal length.
        elif side1 == side2 or side2 == side3 or side1 == side3:
            #Isosceles Right triangle case where sum of squares equals the square of the hypotenuse.
            if sumSquared12 == squareSide3 or sumSquared23 == squareSide1 or sumSquared13 == squareSide2:
                print "It is an isosceles right triangle."
            else:
                print "It is an isosceles triangle."
        #Case for a scalene triangle where all the sides have different lengths.
        elif side1 != side2 and side2 != side3:
            #Scalene right triangle case where sum of squares equals the square of the hypotenuse.
            if sumSquared12 == squareSide3 or sumSquared23 == squareSide1 or sumSquared13 == squareSide2:
                print "It is a scalene right triangle."
            else:
                print "It is a scalene triangle"   
    else:
        #Case where sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.  Hence, the polygon is not a triangle.
        print "The three sided polygon is not a triangle."

    #Asks if you want to enter three more side lengths.
    #If answer is "yes", while loop runs again.  Otherwise, program exits the loop.
    triangle = raw_input("Do you want to enter three more sides? ")

#Here is the exit message.
print "Thank you for using Triangle Tester!"
