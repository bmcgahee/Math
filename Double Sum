#Title: Double Sum
#Date: 10/11/2016
#Purpose:  This program computes a double summation by finding the inner sum first and then using that sum to find the outer sum, which gets the final sum.  

#Asks the user to enter an upper limit for both the outer and inner sums.
iLimit = int(raw_input("Enter an upper limit for outer sum: "))
jLimit = int(raw_input("Enter an upper limit for inner sum: "))

#Intialize sumj variable.
sumj = 0

#Nested For Loop calculates the double sum.  
for i in range(1, iLimit + 1):
    #Inner For Loop calculate the inner sum first.
    #Outer For Loop calculates the outer sum, which is the sum of the inner sum.
    for j in range(1, jLimit + 1):
        #Adds up the formula i*j inside the inner For Loop.  The formula i*j can be replaced with another formula in terms of i and j
        , say 2*i + j for example.  
        sumj = sumj + i*j        
#Prints the double sum.  
print "Double Sum = " + str(sumj)
