#Title: Compound Interest Calculator
#Purpose: This program lets you calculate how much money you will receive provided the principal, rate of return, and
#the number of years you invest.


#Input the principal, rate of return, and number of years for investment.
principal = int(raw_input("Enter amount you want to invest: "))
rate = float(raw_input("Enter annual rate of return on investment: "))
time = int(raw_input("Enter number of years you want to invest: "))

#Initialize year at 1.
year = 1

#While loop executes to calculate the amount received on the investment each year.
while year <= time:
    #compound interest formula
    amount = principal * (1 + rate / 100.0)**year
    #rounds the amount to two decimal places
    roundAmount = round(amount, 2)
    if year == 1:
        print "You earned $" + str(roundAmount) + " after " + str(year) + " year."
    else:
        print "You earned $" + str(roundAmount) + " after " + str(year) + " years."
    year += 1
