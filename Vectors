#Purpose: This program asks the user to enter the components of two vectors A and B.
#The program calculates the magnitude of each vector, their dot product, determines whether the vectors are orthogonal or not,
#and finds the angle between them.

#Import math and time modules.
import math
import time

#Ask user to enter x and y components for vector A.
Ax = int(raw_input("Enter x component for vector A: "))
Ay = int(raw_input("Enter y component for vector A: "))

#Ask the user to enter x and y components for vector B.
Bx = int(raw_input("Enter x component for vector B: "))
By = int(raw_input("Enter y component for vector B: "))

#Store the x and y components for vectors A and B.
vA = [Ax, Ay]
vB = [Bx, By]

#Calculate the magnitude (length) of vectors A and B.
magA = math.sqrt(Ax*Ax + Ay*Ay)
magB = math.sqrt(Bx*Bx + By*By)

#Round their magnitudes to two decimal places.
magARound = round(magA, 2)
magBRound = round(magB, 2)

#Calculate the dot product of vectors A and B.
dotAB = Ax*Bx + Ay*By

#Calculate the angle between vectors A and B and convert angle to degrees, rounding to the nearest degree.
cosAngle = dotAB / (magA*magB)
invCos = math.acos(cosAngle)
invCosDeg = invCos * 180.0 / math.pi
angle = round(invCosDeg, 2)

#Display all of the information about the two vectors that includes vectors in component form, magnitudes, dot product, and the angle between them.
print "Here is the information about the two vectors."

print vA
print "vector B: "
print vB
print "The magnitude of vector A: " + str(magARound) + " units"
print "The magnitude of vector B: " + str(magBRound) + " units"

#If dot product is 0, then the vectors are orthogonal.  Otherwise they are not orthogonal.
if dotAB == 0:
    print "The dot product is: " + str(dotAB) + " The vectors are orthogonal."
else:
    print "The dot product is: " + str(dotAB) + " The vectors are not orthogonal."

print "The angle between vector A and vector B is: " + str(angle) + " degrees."
