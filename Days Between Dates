#Title: Days Between Dates
#Date: 10/6/2015
#Purpose:  This program lets the user input a starting month, day, and year and an ending month, day, and year
and then calculates the number of days between the two dates.

#Import datetime module.
import datetime

#Ask user to input start date that includes month, day, and year.
startMonth = int(raw_input("Enter month in MM format for starting month: "))
startDay = int(raw_input("Enter day in DD format for starting day: "))
startYear = int(raw_input("Enter year in YYYY format for starting year: "))

#Ask user to input end date that incudes month, day, and year.
endMonth = int(raw_input("Enter month in MM format for ending month: "))
endDay = int(raw_input("Enter day in DD format for ending day: "))
endYear = int(raw_input("Enter year in YYYY format for ending year: "))

#Sets up the first and second days as datetime objects.
day1 = datetime.datetime(startYear, startMonth, startDay)
day2 = datetime.datetime(endYear, endMonth, endDay)

#Finds the difference between the two dates in days.
diff = abs(day1 - day2)
dayDiff = diff.days

#Displays the number of days between the two dates.  
print str(dayDiff) + " days"
