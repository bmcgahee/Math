'Title: The Combination Lock Game
'Date: 10/4/2015
'Purpose:  This game lets you guess the correct 4 number combination.  
'At the end of the game, the computer tells you the correct combination and how many guesses it took to find it.

'Introduction to the game
PRINT "Welcome to The Combination Lock Game!"
PRINT "There are four numbers you have to guess correctly in the right order."
PRINT "Each of the four numbers in the combination are between 1 and 5."
PRINT "Let's begin."

'Activate the random number generator.
RANDOMIZE TIMER

'Sets the 4 random number variable for the combination lock.
firstNumber = INT(RND * 5) + 1
secondNumber = INT(RND * 5) + 1
thirdNumber = INT(RND * 5) + 1
fourthNumber = INT(RND * 5) + 1

'Initialize the guess variable.
guess = 0

'DO Loop executes during the game until all 4 numbers have been guessed correctly in the right order.
DO
    'Initialize the correct variable.
    correct = 0

    'Ask the player to guess the 4 numbers.
    INPUT "Guess the first number: ", number1
    INPUT "Guess the second number: ", number2
    INPUT "Guess the third number: ", number3
    INPUT "Guess the fourth number: ", number4

    'If first number is correct then computer lets the player know and adds 1 to correct numbers.
    IF number1 = firstNumber THEN
        PRINT "First number is correct!"
        correct = correct + 1
    'If first number is incorrect then computer tells the player if the number is high or low. 
    ELSE
        IF number1 > firstNumber THEN PRINT "First number is high."
        IF number1 < firstNumber THEN PRINT "First number is low."
    END IF

    'The same logic from above applies to the other 3 numbers.

    IF number2 = secondNumber THEN
        PRINT "Second number is correct!"
        correct = correct + 1
    ELSE
        IF number2 > secondNumber THEN PRINT "Second number is high."
        IF number2 < secondNumber THEN PRINT "Second number is low."
    END IF

    IF number3 = thirdNumber THEN
        PRINT "Third number is correct!"
        correct = correct + 1
    ELSE
        IF number3 > thirdNumber THEN PRINT "Third number is high."
        IF number3 < thirdNumber THEN PRINT "Third number is low."
    END IF

    IF number4 = fourthNumber THEN
        PRINT "Fourth number is correct!"
        correct = correct + 1
    ELSE
        IF number4 > fourthNumber THEN PRINT "Fourth number is high."
        IF number4 < fourthNumber THEN PRINT "Fourth number is low."
    END IF
    'Add 1 to total number of guesses after player guesses all 4 numbers.
    guess = guess + 1
LOOP UNTIL correct = 4

'Tells the player that he or she guessed the correct combination, what the correct combination is, and how many guesses it took to find it.
PRINT "Congratulations!  You guessed the correct combination."
PRINT firstNumber, secondNumber, thirdNumber, fourthNumber
PRINT "It took you "; guess; " guesses to figure out the correct combination."
