#Title: Day Of The Week
#Date: 2/16/2016
#Purpose: This program determines the day of the week for a given date based on the user providing the month, day, and year.
#Note:  The disparate variation of Gauss' algorithm is applied in this program.


#Import the math module.
import math

#Ask user to input month, day, and year for the date.
month = raw_input("Enter the month: ")
day = int(raw_input("Enter the day: "))
year = int(raw_input("Enter the year: "))

#Use floor function to determine first two digits of the century.
centuryCode = math.floor(year / 100)

#If year is divisible by 100, the yearCode is 0.  Otherwise, it is the difference between the year and 100 times the centuryCode.
if year % 100 == 0:
    yearCode = 0
else:
    yearCode = year - centuryCode * 100

#Initialize monthNumber value at 0.
monthNumber = 0

#Let March = 1, April = 2, May = 3,...,January = 11, February = 12.
if month == "March":
    monthNumber = 1
elif month == "April":
    monthNumber = 2

elif month == "August":
    monthNumber = 6
elif month == "September":
    monthNumber = 7
elif month == "October":
    monthNumber = 8
elif month == "November":
    monthNumber = 9
elif month == "December":
    monthNumber = 10
elif month == "January":
    monthNumber = 11
    yearCode = yearCode - 1
elif month == "February":
    monthNumber = 12
    yearCode = yearCode - 1

#Use floor function and monthNumber to get the monthCode.
monthCode = math.floor(2.6 * monthNumber - 0.2)

#Use the floor function to get the quarterYearCode and quarterCenturyCode values.
quarterYearCode = math.floor(yearCode / 4)
quarterCenturyCode = math.floor(centuryCode / 4)

#Double the centuryCode.
doubleCenturyCode = 2 * centuryCode

#Combine all previous values together to get codeSum.  This value is divided by 7 since there are 7 days in the week.
codeSum = day + monthCode + yearCode + quarterYearCode + quarterCenturyCode - doubleCenturyCode

#weekValue is the remainder of codeSum mod 7.
weekValue = codeSum % 7

#Initialize weekDay as an empty string.
weekDay = ""

#Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2,...,Saturday = 6.
if weekValue == 0:
    weekDay = "Sunday"
elif weekValue == 1:
    weekDay = "Monday"
elif weekValue == 2:
    weekDay = "Tuesday"
elif weekValue == 3:
    weekDay = "Wednesday"
elif weekValue == 4:
    weekDay = "Thursday"
elif weekValue == 5:
    weekDay = "Friday"
elif weekValue == 6:
    weekDay = "Saturday"

#Prints the day of the week for that given date.  
print month + " " + str(day) + " " + str(year) + " is on a " + weekDay + "."
