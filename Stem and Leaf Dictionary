#Title: Stem and Leaf Dictionary
#Date: 4/4/2016
#Purpose: The stemLeaf function takes in a list of one and two digit numbers and
#outputs a dictionary that describes a stem and leaf plot in statistics.
#The stem is the first digit in the two digit number. If the stem is a single digit, then it is 0.
#The leaf is the last digit in the two digit number.  If the stem is a single digit, the leaf is that number.

    leafThree = []#list to store all the leaves when stem is 3
