#Title: Factoring x^2 + bx + c
#Date: 9/30/2015
#Purpose: The canBeFactored() function determines if the trinomial x^2 + bx + c can be factored.
#Choose b for the coefficient of x, c for the constant term, and p and q are the factors of c.
#For example, to find if x^2 - 4x + 3 can be factored, use canBeFactored(-4, 3, 1, 3), canBeFactored(-4, 3, -1, -3), etc.

#Define canBeFactored() function.
def canBeFactored(b, c, p, q):
    product = p*q
    add = p + q
    #The case when factors of c whose product is not b.
    if product != c:
        print "Enter factors p and q whose product is " + str(c) + "."
    #The case when factors of c add up to b makes the trinomial factorable.  
    if product == c and add == b:
        return True
    #The case when factors of c do not add to b, which makes the trinomial not factorable.
    elif product == c and add != b:
        return False
    else:
        return
