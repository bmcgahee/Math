#Title: Water Bucket Problem
#Date: 2/11/2016
#Purpose:  This program allows the user to solve the water problem, where
#you have two buckets: 7 gallon and 11 gallon, and use the operations of
#filling a bucket, emptying a bucket, or pouring from one bucket to another to get one of
#the buckets to get the target volume of 6 gallons.


#Set both the 7 (x bucket) and 11 gallon (y bucket) buckets as empty.
#Set the x bucket maximum to 7 gallons and the y bucket maximum to 11 gallons.
#Set the target result to 6 gallons.
x = 0
xMax = 7
y = 0
yMax = 11
target = 6

#The case when both x and y buckets are empty.
if x == 0 and y == 0:
    bucket = raw_input("Which bucket would you like to fill with water? ")
    #Fill the x bucket to 7 gallons.
    if bucket == "x":
        x = xMax
    #Fill the y bucket to 11 gallons.
    elif bucket == "y":
        y = yMax
        
#Print the current volume of the x and y buckets.
print "x contains: " + str(x) + " gallons."
print "y contains: " + str(y) + " gallons."

#While loop executes until one of the buckets has 6 gallons.
while x != target and y != target:
    #User has a choice of filling, emptying, or pouring water into one of the buckets.
    action = raw_input("Do you want to fill, empty, or pour water? ")

    #The fill case for when x or y buckets is not full.
    if action == "fill" and (x != xMax or y != yMax):
        #Choose x bucket or y bucket to fill.

        #Fill x bucket. 
        if fill == "x" and x != xMax:

        #x bucket is already full.
