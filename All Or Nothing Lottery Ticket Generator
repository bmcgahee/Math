#Introduction to the rules of All Or Nothing
print "All Or Nothing is a game where you pick 12 numbers from numbers 1-24.  If you match all or none of the winning numbers then you win!"

#5 second delay
time.sleep(5)

#Asks the player how many tickets he or she wants to purchase.
tickets = int(raw_input("How many tickets do you want to purchase? "))

#Confirms the number of tickets to purchase.
print "You want " + str(tickets) + " tickets.  We can do that.  Coming right up!"

#For Loop takes a random sample of 12 numbers from 1-24, sorts them, and appends those numbers to the lottery ticket list.
for i in range(tickets):
    allOrNothing.append(sorted(random.sample(range(1, 25), 12)))

#5 second delay
time.sleep(5)
