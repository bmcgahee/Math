#Title: Right Triangle Solver
#Purpose: This program lets you find the missing side of a right triangle given two known sides.

#Import math module.
import math

#Instructs the user on how to use the program.  Make sure to enter a 0 if the side is unknown.
print "Enter the length for each side of the right triangle.  Enter a 0 if the side is unknown."

#Asks the user what the lengths are for the first side, second side, and hypotenuse.
side1 = float(raw_input("What is the length of the first side? "))
side2 = float(raw_input("What is the length of the second side? "))
hypotenuse = float(raw_input("What is the length of the hypotenuse? "))

#While Loop executes if the length of the hypotenuse is less than the length of the first or second sides.
while hypotenuse < side1 or hypotenuse < side2:
    print "The length of the hypotenuse cannot be less than the first side or second side."
    hypotenuse = float(raw_input("What is the length of the hypotenuse? "))

#Finds the length of the hypotenuse given the length of the first and second sides.
if side1 != 0 and side2 != 0 and hypotenuse == 0:
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt(side1 * side1 + side2 * side2)
    print "The hypotenuse has a length of: " + str(hypotenuse) + " units"

#Finds the length of the first side given the length of the hypotenuse and second side.
if side2 != 0 and hypotenuse != 0 and side1 == 0:
    side1 = math.sqrt(hypotenuse * hypotenuse - side2 * side2)
    print "The first side has a length of: " + str(side1) + " units"

#Finds the length of the second side given the length of the hypotenuse and first side.
if side1 != 0 and hypotenuse != 0 and side2 == 0:
    side2 = math.sqrt(hypotenuse * hypotenuse - side1 * side1)
    print "The second side has a length of: " + str(side2) + " units"
