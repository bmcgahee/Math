#Title:  Bubble Sort Algorithm
#Date:  3/15/2016
#Purpose:  This programs lets you choose how many numbers you want to put in a list
#and then you append all the numbers in the list by using a for loop.
#The bubble uses a double for loop to look at any two adjacent numbers.
#If the second number is less than the first number, assign it to a temp variable, and
#then swap the two numbers.  Bubble sort does this process until all of the numbers
#have been sorted in numerical order.  

amount = int(raw_input("How many numbers do you want in the list? "))
numbers = []

for n in range(0, amount):
    number = int(raw_input("Enter number: "))
    numbers.append(number)
    
for i in range(0, len(numbers) - 1):
    for j in range(0, len(numbers) - 1 - i):
        numberPass = j + 1
        if numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]:
            temp = numbers[j + 1]
            numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j]
            numbers[j] = temp
        print numbers
        
print "Here is the sorted list of numbers:"
print numbers
