#Title: Averages & Ratios
#Date: 12/20/2015
#Purpose:  This program allows you to calculate the average of two numbers (the left and right endpoints).
#The left averages start with the average of the left endpoint and first average and continues with the average of the left endpoint and that average
#and so on.
#The right averages start with the average of the average of the left and right endpoints and the right endpoint and continues with the average of the
#right endpoint and that average and so on.
#For example:  Consider the interval [0, 2].  Then the average of 0 and 2 is 1.  The left average begins with the average of 0 and 1, which is 0.5.
#The next left average is the average of 0 and 0.5, which is 0.25.  The next left average is the average of 0 and 0.25, which is 0.125 and so on.
#The right average begins with average of 0 and 2, which is 1.  Then the next right average is the average of 1 and 2, which is 1.5.
#Then the next right average is 1.75 and so on.
#The program also calculates the ratios of consecutive terms in both the left and right averages lists.


#Ask the user to input the left and right endpoints.
a = float(raw_input("Enter a left endpoint: "))
b = float(raw_input("Enter a right endpoint: "))

#While Loop executes when value of a is greater than or equal to b.
while a >= b:
    a = float(raw_input("Enter a left endpoint: "))
    b = float(raw_input("Enter a right endpoint: "))

#Ask the user for the number of iterations.
i = int(raw_input("How many iterations? "))

#Declare the empty left and right averages list to store values in the For Loop
leftAvgList = []
rightAvgList = []

leftRatios = []
rightRatios = []

#For Loop executes i number of iterations, calculating the left and right averages,
#and storing them in their appropriate lists.
for n in range(1, i + 1):
    leftAvg = ((2**n - 1)*a + b) / 2**n
    rightAvg = (a + (2**n - 1)*b) / 2**n
    leftAvgList.append(leftAvg)
    rightAvgList.append(rightAvg)

#For Loop executes up to 1 less than the length of the left average list number of iterations,
#and calculates the ratios of the n-term and n+1-term in the left and right average lists and stores them
#in the left and right ratio lists.
for n in range(0, len(leftAvgList) - 1):
    rLeft = leftAvgList[n] / leftAvgList[n + 1]
    rRight = rightAvgList[n] / rightAvgList[n + 1]
    leftRatios.append(rLeft)
    rightRatios.append(rRight)
    

#Prints out the list of left averages.
print "Here are the left averages: "
print leftAvgList

#Prints out the list of right averages.
print "Here are the right averages: "
print rightAvgList

#Prints out the list of left ratios.
print "Here are the left ratios: "
print leftRatios

#Prints out the list of right ratios. 
print "Here are the right ratios: "
